- 👋 Hi, I’m Markus!
- 👀 I’m interested in cars and anything computer related - really - but also science in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter, C#, a little rust, c++ and java, aswell as Powershell and everything that's needed to get something done ^^
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that need some love but don't get time.
